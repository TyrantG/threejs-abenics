# threejs-abenics

My attempt at recreating [ABENICS active ball joint](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHUv9Zda_48) maths using three.js based on [original paper](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Prototype-of-a-new-active-ball-joint-mechanism-ABENICS_fig1_351357682).

[Modelling of gears here](https://www.floatingintheclouds.com/series/ball-joint/).

Simulation does not currently work correctly! Need **someone** to fix cos I am done with it.

* Demo running here: [https://aegis1980.github.io/threejs-abenics/](https://aegis1980.github.io/threejs-abenics/). Takes a moment to show up.
* To run locally: with vs code use Live Server entension. Should serve up as `localhost:5500` in browser.
